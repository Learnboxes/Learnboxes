- 👋 Hi, I’m @Learnboxes, a person who... learns boxes. This is likely new to you.
- 👀 I’m interested in editing my profile, little else save Supertux. I practically exist to upload my worldmap. lol. I'm horrible at programming and annoy the creepy dev with ever-late art, and can't draw worth nothing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use this site, sadly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a glorious failure of a project with my slavedriver/dev. Don't ask.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm not good with giving my email to the world (if it hasn't been yet). Don't try to talk to me.
- 🤮️ Pronouns:  Get real and examine the things...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm mighty smart, when people ask simple questions. Bring it on.
